<p>Everyone has first-day nerves, from brand new teachers to the most experienced educators. My jitters peak during those first few moments of anticipation before students arrive. 
I look around my classroom making sure that everything is in place and, of course, I notice that thereâ€™s one more thing that I could have done. 
But once I see the sea of students in the hallways heading towards my classroom, I take a deep breath and the year begins.
